 * Convert pixel coordinates into camera coordinates:
 1. Raster to NDC, which makes X and Y defined in [0,1]
 2. NDC to canvas
	- The tagent of an angle is the ratio between the opposite and the adjacent.
	If we imagine a triangle that starts at the eye/camera,
	goes to half of the screen (adjacent), crosses the screen (opposite, which is
	half of the canvas width) and then returns to the eye/camera (hypotenuse),
	with an angle of FOV/2. If we get the tagent of that angle (convert to radians
	at pi = 180ยบ), we are getting the ratio between half of the canvas width and
	the distance to screen. If we assume the distance to be 1, than we have 
	half of the width of the canvas. So 2 * Angle = canvas width
	- We can get the height of the canvas using the width and the aspect ratio of
	the window in pixels
	- We know that we can transform the canvas into NDC by adding half the canvas width
	(or height, if y) to shift the origin to 0 and dividing by the canvas width (or height, if y),
	to make the max at 1. Following that, we can transform in canvas with angle * (2x - 1),
	being that angle is half of the canvas width.
 * camera coordinates (x: -1 -> 1, y: -1 -> 1). The camera coordinates correspond to the 2d plane
 * which is drawn and has the camera in the center (no z coordinate)
