 * Convert pixel coordinates into camera coordinates:
 1. Raster to NDC, which makes X and Y defined in [0,1]
 2. NDC to canvas
	- The tagent of an angle is the ratio between the opposite and the adjacent.
	If we imagine a triangle that starts at the eye/camera,
	goes to half of the screen (adjacent), crosses the screen (opposite, which is
	half of the canvas width) and then returns to the eye/camera (hypotenuse),
	with an angle of FOV/2. If we get the tagent of that angle (convert to radians
	at pi = 180ยบ), we are getting the ratio between half of the canvas width and
	the distance to screen. If we assume the distance to be 1, than we have 
	half of the width of the canvas. So 2 * Angle = canvas width
	- We can get the height of the canvas using the width and the aspect ratio of
	the window in pixels
	- We know that we can transform the canvas into NDC by adding half the canvas
	width (or height, if y) to shift the origin to 0 and dividing by the canvas
	width (or height, if y), to make the max at 1. Following that, we can transform
	in canvas with angle * (2x - 1), being that angle is half of the canvas width.
	- This should make the coordinates vary between -1 and 1

 * The look_at function creates the matrix that converts world coordinates

 * row with the translation values (the 3x3 part is the rotation) and we
 * add one last column to facilitate matrix multiplication (checking if the
 * last element is 1 is a good strategy to make sure it's normalized).
 * The matrix:
 * - Row 1: right axis, which would be the x-axis from the camera (x, y, z, 0)
 * - Row 2: up axis, which would be the y-axis from the camera (x, y, z, 0)
 * - Row 3: forward axis, which would be the z-axis from the camera and
 * should be pointing into the camera (x, y, z, 0)
 * - Row 4: camera origin, which is the translation values
 * 
 * How to compute the forward axis?
 * Being that this is going from the camera back, we can use the direction
 * of the vector that goes in the opposite direction of cam_dir and passes 
 * through the origin. So, camera direction - camera origin.
 * 
 * How to compute the right axis?
 * We already have the forward axis and we know that the cross product of
 * 2 vectors gives us a 3rd vector which is perpendicular to both of them.
 * By convention, we use the (0,1,0) vector for that. However, there is
 * one case where this creates a problem: if the forward is (0,1,0) or
 * (0, -1, 0). In that case, we will make the temp vector to be (1,0,0).
 * 
 * How to compute the up axis?
 * Just do the cross product of the 2 known axis to get a 3rd vector that
 * will be perpendicular to both forward and right.
