# miniRT
Doing miniRT with Ant√≥nio.

If you are unsure between doing miniRT and cub3d, [this was the video](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar/rendering/rendering1/v/overview-rendering) that excited me about miniRT because it gave me a real world application of the project.

## Window stuff (aka minilibX stuff)
- Close the window with ESC
- Quit cleanly in the red cross
- Use images of minilibX (?)
- Test covering the window and moving it
- Minimize

## Parsing
The first argument of the program should be a scene description file (.rt)
- Each type of element can be separated by one or more line breaks
- Each piece of information from an element can be separated by one or more spaces
- Each type of element can be set in any order in the file
- Elements which are defined by a capital letter can only be declared once in the scene
- The element first's information is the type identifier (one or two chars), followed by specific information for each object

In case of error or misconfiguration, exit properly + return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice

## Elements
### Ambient lightning (A)
```A  0.2  255,255,255```

Identifier A

Ratio from 0.0 to 1.0

R,G,B colors, ranging from 0 to 255

- There can't be more than 1 ambient light as they don't even have positioning, right?

### Camera (C)
```C  -50.0,0,20  0,0,1  70```

Identifier C

View point coordinates (x,y,z)

3d normalized orientation vector for each x,y,z axis, ranging between -1 and 1

FOV (horizontal field of view) in degrees, ranging from 0 to 180

- There can be more than one camera, the same image can be viewed from multiple points of view

### Light (L)
```L  -40.0,50.0,0.0  0.6  10,0,255```

Identifier L

Coordinates of the light point (x,y,z)

Brightness ratio from 0.0 to 1.0

Bonus: R,G,B colors, ranging from 0 to 255

- There can be more than one light

### Plane (pl)
```pl  0.0,0.0,-10.0  0.0,1.0,0.0  0,0,225```

Identifier pl

Coordinates (x,y,z)

3d normalized orientation vector for each x,y,z axis, ranging between -1 and 1

R,G,B colors, ranging from 0 to 255

Add the formula and relevant notes


### Sphere (sp)
```sp  0.0,0.0,20.6  12.6  10,0,255```

Identifier sp

Coordinates of the sphere center (x,y,z)

Sphere diameter

R,G,B colors, ranging from 0 to 255

Formula + notes


### Cylinder (cy)
```cy  50.0,0.0,20.6  0.0,0.0,1.0  14.2 21.42  10,0,255```

Identifier cy

Coordinates (x,y,z)

3d normalized orientation vector for each x,y,z axis, ranging between -1 and 1

Cylinder diameter

Cylinder height

R,G,B colors, ranging from 0 to 255

I think the formula is going to make it infinite, we need to truncate it on both sides at a certain height and then add the circles as top and bottom


### Triangle (tr)
Not sure how, but I was told if we do triangles, we are able to draw ALL images
